Presenter is created first, he creates view and model, subscribe to event.
Then application starts using link to form provided by presenter.

	Main workflow is like this:
User fills form and clicks search.
Presenter reacts to event, accesing user's input with properties of form.
Presenter calls form method to begin search.
// When search ended  //  Or when user stops it  //
Presenter access results using model properties
and pass them to form usinf form's properties

Why we need presenter to create the view anyway?
